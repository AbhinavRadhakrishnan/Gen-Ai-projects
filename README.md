# 🧠 Generative AI Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Generative AI Projects** repository!  
This repository contains hands-on projects focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and real-world GenAI applications.

The goal of this repository is to explore how modern generative models can be integrated into practical systems such as chatbots, document assistants, and AI-powered tools.
